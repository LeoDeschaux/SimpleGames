# OldSchoolGames  

> :warning: **This project is a work in progress**  

OldSchoolGames is a project in which I try to recreate simple games using Monogame and myEngine in C#.  
It is also a place for me to test the limites of myEngine as it helps me understand what features are necessary to build an actual game.  

**So far, I've recreated :**   
Rock Paper Scissors (not included on GitHub yet)  
TicTacToe (not included on GitHub yet)  
Arkanoid  
Asteroid (unfinished)  
Mine Sweeper  
Pong  
Snake  
Sudoku  

***

**Games that might be added in the futur :**  
Tetris  
a generic 2D Platformer (Mario like)  
a 2D top down adventure game (Zelda like)  
a turn based game (Pokemon like)  
Chess  
a 3D shooter (Doom like)  
a 3D race game (either car or spaceship)
